# Light propagation in Fibers
## How does light travel inside an optical fiber
The optical fiber consists of 2 parts: a core and a cladding. When light comes in it bounces back and forth between the walls of the core. The cladding surrounds the core. Because of the fact that the cladding has a lower refractive index than the core the light is contained within the the fiber. This is called internal reflection. This is because a part of the light could go though the walls of the core.

-How does total internal reflection work
Total internal reflection is the effect that none of the light is refracted through a second medium, but is completely reflected back into the first medium. This happens when the second medium has a lower refractive index than the first medium. For this effect to happen there must be a certain angle between the light and the surface. This is the so-called "critical angle."

-What is the difference between single-mode fiber(SMF) and multimode fiber(MMF)?
Single-mode fibers are fibers where only one wavelength can go through at once. The light goes through the fiber in one straight line without bouncing off the walls of the core. The core (9 micrometer) is a lot smaller than the core of a multimode fiber(50+ micrometer). The multimode fiber can support multiple wavelengths at once. However, unlike in the SMF, the light beams are reflected a lot by the walls of the core. This means that there is a lot of dispersion and therefore the quality of the signal decreases. \\

-What is the fiber mode?
A mode is a path that the light can take inside the fiber.

-Why is it hard to predict the output of a multimode fiber?
Because light is reflected many times by the walls of the core of the fiber, it suffers a lot from dispersion. Therefore, it is not easy to know how the light would have gone if that dispersion wasn't there.

-What is the speckle pattern?
The speckle pattern is a random pattern that is generated by random constructive- and destructive interference. The different light beams can interfere with a seemingly random pattern. This can be caused by the randomness of the surface of the walls of the fiber. This random interference can give a "random" pattern when the light is measured. This gives the speckle pattern?

-Step-index vs graded-index?
In the graded-index fiber, the refractive index is continuously decreasing while the distance to the center is increasing. In this fiber the path of the light has a sine form. In the step-index fiber, the reflective index is uniform. This results in different zig-zag paths.
